Sometimes, I feel as though I’m a distant, distorted memory of a future self—
a mind clouded by Alzheimer’s,
struggling to comprehend flashbacks:
scenes of the unimaginable suffering of a people.

During these delusional episodes,
I see images of starving children,
horrors of collective torment laid bare before everyone’s eyes.

In that distant future reality, I keep telling myself:
I’m confused.
It’s the disease.
It must be my mind playing tricks on me.
Surely, a world of such raw, naked injustice
cannot exist without response.
Cannot persist without consequence.
Surely, such a world should not exist.
It must be a trick of the mind.

It cannot be that those who could break the silence instead carry the tyrant’s voice;
those who could shift the course instead steady terror’s hand—
while the oppressed, the tortured, the unsheltered, and the unfed
are abandoned in a dead vacuum of haughty indifference.
Surely such a world cannot be,
should not be.

When I fall asleep,
my dreams feel like how the world should be—
unremarkable breaths of everyday life.
In the dream state, I find a landing.
I tell myself:
Ah, I just had an episode.
This—this is my real life.
